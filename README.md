This repository contains the code used to show how to manipulate deployment to Azure Websites and WebJobs. Topics covered include:

1. Performing `gulp` based builds for stand-alone client side components.
1. Integrating client side components to a WebAPI and SignalR backend.
1. Adding a WebJob to peform background tasks and notify WebAPI of changes.

Learning how to customize deployment using [Kudu](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu) is the primary focus exercise.
